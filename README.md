# LRU-Cache
LRU caching scheme is to remove the least recently used frame when the cache is full and a new page is referenced which is not there in cache.


# Fastest Approach

1. HASHMAP for the O(1) Lookup time
2. QUEUE to track of order of pages in system

# How to execute the code:
execute the "LRUOperation.java" file.
