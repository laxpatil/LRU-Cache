# LRU-Cache
LRU caching scheme is to remove the least recently used frame when the cache is full and a new page is referenced which is not there in cache.


# A good approach:

-->  HASHMAP for the O(1) lookup time
-->  QUEUE to track of order of pages in system

# How to execute the code:
execute the "LRUOperation.java" file.
